# This study explores the role of miRNAs in predicting clinical outcomes for OS patients. By comprehensively integrating regularized Cox regression for survival analysis, we aim to identify key miRNAs while considering the combined effects of different miRNAs. Furthermore, we employed an unpenalized Cox regression model to assess miRNA significance.
# We hypothesize that changes in specific miRNA levels between pre- and post-amputation plasma samples within each patient are predictive of clinical outcomes in dogs with osteosarcoma after standard-of-care treatment (amputation followed by chemotherapy). These miRNAs may serve as prognostic markers, and we predict that their functional roles in relevant biological pathways contribute to the clinical outcome in patients.
